## Task 1
* Objective: analyze your industry and decide your primary and support activities
* Our company is devoted to the manufacture of gym equipment which can use the kinetic energy generated when using those machines for people's workouts to transform it into electric energy.  
***
* Your company's name: GreenBeats
***
* Your company's NAICS (at least 4-digit) code and associated description from [NAICS Search](https://www.naics.com/search/):
* 335311 - Power, Distribution, and Specialty Transformer Manufacturing
* This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing power, distribution, and specialty transformers (except electronic components). Industrial-type and consumer-type transformers in this industry vary (e.g., step up or step down) voltage but do not convert alternating to direct or direct to alternating current.
*Important note: Your NAICS 4-digit code must start with 31, 32, or 33 (Manufacturing)*
***
* Corporate name and total employees of the top 3 businesses (Click To View Corporate Businesses by Revenue):
* ABB Holdings Inc. → 18,000 employees
* Eaton Electric Holdings LLC. → 26,860 employees
* GRID Solutions (us) LLC. → 4,060 employees
***
* Number of businesses in your NAICS code from [Market Research](https://www.naics.com/market-research/):
*There are 803 businesses in our industry.
***
* List of your company's primary activities divided into engineering activities and operations activities:
* ENGINEERING: 
- Research and development of innovative transformators from kinetic energy into electric energy, which can be implemented into gym equipment. This energy will be provided to other companies that support sustainable energy sources for carrying on their own primary activities.  
- Efficient and user friendly design of these sustainable gym equipment and the generators. Some of these generators’ components will be manufactured by the innovative process of 3D printing, this is why a team will also devote their time to research how to increase the implementation of these technologies in our production process . 
- We will have different teams creating prototypes of the aforementioned generators and equipment to see which ones better meet our goals and function more efficiently, for later patenting them. 

* OPERATIONS ACTIVITIES:
- Some of our operators will be in charge of obtaining and handling the inventory needed for later assembling the gym machines and generators, since not all our supplies will come from our own 3D printing. 
- There will be two independent assembly lines for manufacturing the generators and the gym equipment which, in the end, will be joined to create the final product: sustainable fitness equipment. 
- Afterwards, all of our products will be subject to strict quality controls. 
These activities are mainly routine tasks.

* List of your company's support activities:
* GENERAL MANAGEMENT: In charge of the general functioning of the company, and supervising the performance and implementation of the different engineering and operation activities, as well as the different departments of the company.

## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.
***

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
