## Task 1
* Objective: analyze your industry and decide your primary and support activities
* Our company is devoted to the manufacture of gym equipment which can use the kinetic energy generated when using those machines for people's workouts to transform it into electric energy.  
***
* Your company's name: GreenBeats
***
* Your company's NAICS (at least 4-digit) code and associated description from [NAICS Search](https://www.naics.com/search/):
* 335311 - Power, Distribution, and Specialty Transformer Manufacturing
* This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing power, distribution, and specialty transformers (except electronic components). Industrial-type and consumer-type transformers in this industry vary (e.g., step up or step down) voltage but do not convert alternating to direct or direct to alternating current.
*Important note: Your NAICS 4-digit code must start with 31, 32, or 33 (Manufacturing)*

***
* Number of businesses in your NAICS code from [Market Research](https://www.naics.com/market-research/):
*There are 803 businesses in our industry.
***
* List of your company's primary activities divided into engineering activities and operations activities:
* ENGINEERING: 
- Research and development of innovative transformators from kinetic energy into electric energy, which can be implemented into gym equipment. This energy will be provided to other companies that support sustainable energy sources for carrying on their own primary activities.  
- Efficient and user friendly design of these sustainable gym equipment and the generators. Some of these generators’ components will be manufactured by the innovative process of 3D printing, this is why a team will also devote their time to research how to increase the implementation of these technologies in our production process . 
- We will have different teams creating prototypes of the aforementioned generators and equipment to see which ones better meet our goals and function more efficiently, for later patenting them. 

* OPERATIONS ACTIVITIES:
- Some of our operators will be in charge of obtaining and handling the inventory needed for later assembling the gym machines and generators, since not all our supplies will come from our own 3D printing. 
- There will be two independent assembly lines for manufacturing the generators and the gym equipment which, in the end, will be joined to create the final product: sustainable fitness equipment. 
- Afterwards, all of our products will be subject to strict quality controls. 
These activities are mainly routine tasks.

## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators your company will have in one year from now.
***
In order to predict the firm's number of available workers with the given data and using Python, we will compute different matrixes. To keep it simple, the formula used is the following: a= MD^(-1)b
where:
* a = is a column vector with the number of workers expected to be next year in each occupation, this is, the result we want to get. 
* M = is a square matrix with the number of workers that remain in the company. In the diagonal, the ones that remain in the same occupation after one year, this is, 5 managers, 10 engineers and 45 operators. And in the other positions the workers that have changed their occupation, this would be, 5 managers have changed to operators, and 2 engineers have changed to managers and other 5 to operators, the rest of the matrix would be 0 values. 
* D is a diagonal matrix with the number of workers in each occupation last year, this is, 15 managers, 20 engineers and 50 operators. But we will use its inverse, and for this, these numbers would be the denominator of a 1/x division.
* b = is a column vector with the number of workers in the present, this is, 1 manager, 1 engineer and 2 operators. 
***
Making the necessary calculations with the platform Python we have been able to obtain the number of available workers for this present year. Taking into account that our company started this year with 1 manager, 1 engineer and 2 operators; as well as considering the historical data from another company to estimate the availability of workers for this year, we have obtained that the expected number of available workers at the end of 2021 (integer) will be 1 engineer and 2 operators. On the other hand, there will not be any available managers. 
***

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
***
In order to forecast the firm's demand for workers, we have considered a linear model: 𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽𝑥𝑖𝑡 + 𝛿1𝑜1𝑡 + 𝛿2𝑜2𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖t where:
* yit represents the firm's need for workers in occupation i, in this case, managers, engineers, and operators; and year t, this is, 2021.
* xt represents a labor market indicator that changes over time. We will select in this case percentage of unemployment for each of the occupations.
* oi equals 1 for occupation i; 0 otherwise. It is a dummy variable. 
We have used Python to make the necessary computations so that the work is easier. After applying the formula:  [𝜷̂^ 𝜹̂^𝟏 𝜹̂^𝟐]= [X'X]^−𝟏𝑿′y where we have all the data, we obtain the estimated coefficients by applyting ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to available data. y is a column vector of dimension 9 that contains historical data on the demand for workers in each of the 3 occupations and in 3 different years. X is an 9 x 4 matrix that contains historical data on the labor market indicator x in each of the 3 occupations and in the three different years.  

Secondly, we plug the estimated coefficients into the linear model to make predictions on the firm's demand for workers using 𝐲̂ = X^[𝜷̂^𝜹̂^𝟏 𝜹̂^𝟐] where 𝐲̂ is a column vector of dimension 3 with the predicted need for workers in each of the 3 occupations; and X^ is a 3x3 matrix that contains predicted data on unemployment. 

Finally, we have obtained the following results for the predicted firm's demand of workers. As with the prediction of available workers these numbers represent people, it is convinient to express them as integers: we will need 4 managers, 12 engineers and 7 operators in December 2021. Finally, compare the predicted available workers with the predicted need of workers to detect mismatches. A shortage of 4 managers, 11 engineers and 5 operators can be expected. Therefore, we will carry out an upsizing strategy. We consider hiring to be the best option since many workers are needed.
